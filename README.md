## Why use Chic AI? 🧠
Ever stood in front of your closet thinking, “I have nothing to wear” — even when it’s full? Want to organize your wardrobe without the overwhelm?

## Framework & Tech Stack 🧵
- **LLaVA Image Recognition** - Chic AI identifies individual clothing items from user-uploaded images and extracts detailed fashion attributes to populate your virtual closet with precision.

## Challenges We Faced 🪄
 - **Image Generation** – Stable Diffusion was inconsistent, and GPT-4o had limits. We solved this by building a custom Copilot agent for fast, consistent, and fully automated flat-lay visuals.
 - **UI/UX** – Packing all features into one app was tough, especially as a solo dev used to backend work. It was a fun dive into mobile UI design and balancing functionality with simplicity.
